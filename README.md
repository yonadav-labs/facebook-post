Facebook Post / Comment browse site
===================================

We need to build off this script -  https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper


I'm looking to convert this into an app people could sign-up for. It would require a user system. Although, at the same time, I want to database all the queries people make, and pull from them (first), so it saves API calls. Facebook limits the amount of API calls. Although, I want the software to know when the database hasn't been updated in a few days, and to pull the new posts.


User system
Database all queries into MySQL
	Include all reactions
	Include all comments (all words) for a post
View all data in a nice list GUI
	Show pages extracted
	Show individual posts for that page after page is clicked
	Show comments for post after post is clicked
Allow posts to be rewritten, saved
